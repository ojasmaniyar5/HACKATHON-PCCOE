*Describing Project Idea by using various programming languages.*

**PS ID** : AB05

**Problem Statement :**
*Developing a Conversational Recommender System for Stock Investments.*

**Description :**

*In the changing landscape of financial markets, investors face the challenge
of navigating a vast sea of information to make sound and timely
investment decisions. The need for a sophisticated, user-friendly solution
becomes evident as traditional methods often fall short in delivering
personalized and real-time insights. To address this pressing issue, we aim
to develop a cutting-edge Conversational Recommender System tailored to
guide investors in selecting the most suitable stocks for their unique
financial goals and risk profiles*
*A Conversational Recommendation System is a model that is capable of
communicating with a user in fluent natural language about a particular
topic and is able to provide good recommendations for the same. The
system goes beyond traditional recommendation engines by facilitating
interactive dialogues, enabling users to receive tailored suggestions and
information in a conversational manner.*

**Challenges in current scenario :**

1] *Information Overload*: Investors are provided with a constant stream of
financial data, making it challenging to distill relevant information for
effective decision-making.
2] *Timeliness of Recommendations*: The volatile nature of financial
markets demands real-time analysis and recommendations. Existing
systems often struggle to provide up-to-the-minute insights, leaving
investors at a disadvantage.
3] *Complexity in Decision-Making*: The intricacies of stock market
dynamics can be overwhelming, particularly for novice investors. The
application should simplify the decision-making process, offering clear
explanations and insights to empower users with the knowledge
needed to make informed investment choices.
4] *Risk Management*: The inherent risks associated with stock investments
necessitate a robust risk management strategy. The system must
incorporate advanced risk assessment capabilities to guide users
towards investments that match their risk tolerance, ensuring a
balanced and secure portfolio.
5] *Complex Financial Instruments*: The availability of complex financial
instruments, such as derivatives and options, adds a layer of complexity
for investors. Understanding and effectively utilizing these instruments
require a higher level of financial literacy and expertise.

**Expected Solution:**

1] A conversational recommendation model that can handle natural,
human language input and output. The model should possess some
basic Natural Language Understanding.
2] The modelâ€™s responses should be sound and up-to-date.
3] The UI for the model should be user-friendly and intuitive. It should
cater to the needs of an everyday investor and provide them with a
strong recommendation based on the current market situation.
4] The model should be able to understand the complex constructs about
the functioning of the market conditions.
5] The model must not hallucinate.
6] The model should possess some level of unbiased recommendation.
7] While we expect you to fine-tune your own LLM, usage of LLM APIs are
allowed. We encourage your creativity and originality.
8] Although it is expected that your model learns from historical data, while
making predictions, real-time data should be considered.


**Bonus Points:**

1] Models with Natural Language Output will be given preference.
2] Models with no inherent bias whatsoever will be given preference.
3] Models which are able to minimize the risk in investing, thus minimizing
the overall risk of the portfolio would be given preference.
4] Models which are able to handle personalized and individualistic biases
of the user towards a particular investment resource, would be given
preference.
5] Models that will be able to simulate market conditions and give a strong,
accurate opinion about the stock in question, will be given a preference.
6] An intuitive analytics dashboard that visually presents key performance
indicators, portfolio metrics, and market trends, would be given a
preference.
